                    <p>For on-your-knees gardening, this tool has a short handle and smaller-than-normal blade that make it just right for transplanting or pot filling. It is also excellent for children since it is a real shovel, not a piece of flimsy tin. 27" overall, it has a steel blade (5 1/2" × 8") and wooden handle.

                        Other obvious uses are for camping or as an emergency tool kept in the car trunk, but nowhere will you appreciate it more than in your garden.
