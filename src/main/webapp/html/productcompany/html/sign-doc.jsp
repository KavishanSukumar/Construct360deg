                <p>
                    Although rules and regulators are quite different from each other, they are often confused. This is because both must be followed. But in fact, they differ from each other in their purpose of creation. In this article, we want to explain the difference between rules and regulations.
                    Rules are guidelines and instructions for doing something right. It is created to manage behavior in an organization or country. They are written principles. On the other hand, regulations are directives made in addition to the laws in a particular country. These are arranged according to the places that are missing in the existing system.
                    <br> <br>
                    The main difference between rule and regulation is that the nature of the rules is more flexible. On the other hand, the heart of the regulations is more stringent. Rules are set according to individuals and organizations, regulations according to the state. Another difference between the two is the rules are the set of instructions given to the public. Regulations are rules accepted legally by the administration. Rules are part of the regulation, but regulations are part of the law.
                    The reason why the two concepts are confused is that they have many similarities. For example, both are part of the constitution. However, violation of both concepts can result in penalties.
